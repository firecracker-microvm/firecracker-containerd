# containerd-firecracker-snapshotter

This component is a
[snapshotter](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/design/snapshots.md)
[plugin](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/PLUGINS.md) for
containerd that stores snapshots in flat, ext4-formatted filesystem images.
The snapshots created by this snapshotter are usable with the
containerd-firecracker-runtime to run microVM-backed containers with the
Firecracker VMM.

## Installation

To make containerd aware of this plugin, you need to register it in
containerd's configuration file.  This file is typically located at
`/etc/containerd/config.toml`.

Here's a sample entry that can be made in the configuration file:

```toml
[proxy_plugins]
  [proxy_plugins.firecracker-snapshotter]
    type = "snapshot"
    address = "/var/run/firecracker-snapshotter.sock"
```

The name of the plugin in this example is "firecracker-snapshotter".  The
`address` entry points to a socket file exposed by the snapshotter, which is
determined when you run it.

## Usage

```
./snapshotter -address UNIX-DOMAIN-SOCKET -path ROOT -debug
```

To run the snapshotter, you must specify both a Unix domain socket and a root
directory where the snapshots will be stored.  For example, to run the
snapshotter with its domain socket at `/var/run/firecracker-snapshotter.sock`
and its storage at `/var/lib/firecracker-snapshotter`, you would run the
snapshotter plugin process as follows:

```
./snapshotter -address /var/run/firecracker-snapshotter.sock -path /var/lib/firecracker-snapshotter
```

Now you can use snapshotter with containerd:

```
CONTAINERD_SNAPSHOTTER=firecracker-snapshotter ctr images pull docker.io/library/alpine:latest
```
