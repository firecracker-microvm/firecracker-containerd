# firecracker-containerd architecture

This repository contains several components with the goal of enabling the
[containerd](https://containerd.io) container runtime to create and manage
[Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) microVMs.

These components are implemented using containerd's extension mechanisms, so
you can configure your existing installation of containerd to work with
Firecracker microVMs.

There are currently three components in this repository:

* A [snapshotter](../snapshotter)
  that creates files used as block-devices for pass-through into the
  microVM.  This snapshotter is used for providing the container image
  to the microVM.  The snapshotter runs as an out-of-process gRPC
  proxy plugin.
* A [runtime](../runtime)
  linking containerd (outside the microVM) to the Firecracker virtual
  machine manager (VMM).  The runtime is implemented as an
  out-of-process
  [shim runtime](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/2426)
  communicating over ttrpc.
* An
  [agent](../agent)
  running inside the microVM, which invokes [runC](https://runc.io)
  via containerd's `containerd-shim-runc-v1` to create standard Linux
  containers inside the microVM.
  
A high-level diagram of the various components and their interactions can be
seen below:

  them can be found in the [shim design doc](shim-design.md).
